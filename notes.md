Dynamically assign block size for Data type used (Problem serde needs minimum of 32 or 48 bytes for a node) Node is not just data but refs and comp=

#Problem
HOW is id of innnerElement usize an ID of its Node but Node does not have an id field? Is it index in BFA?

Node ID =/= Element.comp 

#LookHere
put Node Elements in own Dir
put insert/search(interval)/travers(print) in own file

Test BFA more
(No?)bubble_sort/or alt for split_inner 

#DOCs
Tree has Inner Nodes and Leaf Nodes
Nodes have their own ID a Vector of Elements
ELemente

every Node is a block (i think)
